## Who we are

PEI Developers is simply an informal group of software developers, web designers, and other techies.

We meet monthly, and organize hackathons on occasion. Some time back, our co-organizers drafted a mission statement. Here it is…

At PEI Developers, we value:

**Inclusion**. You are welcome here. We offer a friendly atmosphere regardless of gender, race, LGBT, and so on. We aren’t a youth centre, but we welcome talented young people who are engaged in software development.

**Openness**. We celebrate the principles of Open Data. Open-source is a given.

**Individuals**. We encourage the development of the individual software developer (as opposed to a business incubator). We mentor on development, presentation skills, project management and more. Our group ranges widely in experience, but we all share a common passion for software.

**Community**.  We want to interact with existing organizations to build a “tech scene” on PEI. We’ll work with government, industry, schools, youth: you name it. We’re opinionated, independent, and eager to help
