At long last, Michael Easter has written a recap of the conferences mentioned at the June Meet-Up. Check out [A Week in Ottawa: Partying with the Data Nerds](http://thirtyforsixty.blogspot.ca/2015/07/a-week-in-ottawa-partying-with-data.html) over on his blog.

Michael will write a follow-up brief on CKAN Con (CKAN is an open-source, web-based data management system).
