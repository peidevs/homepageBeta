Hello Hackers!

Some notes before [our event on Saturday, Jan 24](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/pei-devs-hackathon-tickets-15252848681).

To re-iterate our goals, they are easy:

* have fun (#1 with a bullet)
* meet nerds, network
* build something neat, which is demonstrable and placed on a public repo (e.g. GitHub)

Here are some answers to common questions

**How do I prepare ?**

* Think about some ideas you might like to work on (more below)
* Bring a laptop with your tools installed. Developers and designers should have their working environment already set up.
* We want to show off our efforts, so developers should set up an account on GitHub

**What is “something neat” ?**

You decide! More below, but everyone has the chance to pitch an idea in the AM. You’ll vote on the project that sounds “neat” to you.

**What is “demonstrable” ?**

Your team will demo your effort in the PM. A “demo” can range from a slick UI to a code-level API that you’ve written on the back-end. Whatever works for you, but we do ask that there is something to show, even if it is just the start of a larger idea. Prefer a coherent narrative over completeness.

**Why a public repo ?**

Having a body of work will show the world what our IT community can do. Set up on [GitHub](https://github.com)!

**More on ideas**

Please think about ideas you’d like to pitch. Try and find an idea that you’re passionate about: when you “scratch the itch”, then presenting the idea will be effortless.

The pitch can be a mobile app, civic hacking (aka open data), or a hyper-local app, tailored for life on PEI. Surprise us!

For some potential data sources, consider these:

* [Open Data in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data_in_Canada)
* [Halifax Open Data](http://www.halifax.ca/opendata/)
* [Open Street Map (PEI)](http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391115)
* [Open Government Portal](http://open.canada.ca/en)

**Most Important**

This event is stress-free, and not about nerds competing to find the top alpha-geek! We’re chill. Come inside and play!

see you soon,

PEI Devs
