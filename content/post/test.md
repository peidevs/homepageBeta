Hello Devs, Designers, and App Fans,

[PEI Developers](https://meetup.com/pei-developers), in partnership with generous sponsors, is happy to announce a [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) on January 24!

[Here is your invite ](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/pei-devs-hackathon-tickets-15252848681)with all the details.

This isn’t our first rodeo, so we know you may have questions. More to come, but for now, know that:



* This is a one-day event with a focus on fun and being nerdy.
* You don’t have to be a coder to contribute! If you’re a graphic/web designer, project leader, or an enthusiastic thinker, we’ll find a spot for you.
* We are open, inclusive, and friendly.



Please register ASAP: it helps us with planning!
