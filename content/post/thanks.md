PEI Hacks was a big success! Six teams demonstrated software after 8 hours of collaboration and coding. From all accounts, everyone had fun.

Over the next few days, we’ll describe the efforts and the day, but for now we want to thank so many people / sponsors.

You

Thanks again to everyone who came out. We had about 30 participants, some of whom traveled from Halifax and Fredericton, and all of whom came inside to play on a gorgeous Saturday. Thanks!![](/uploads/2017/04/24/tumblr_inline_ms33szlsLD1qz4rgp.jpg)
